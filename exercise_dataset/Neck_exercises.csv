Cable Neck Flexion,https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Sternocleidomastoid/CBNeckFlx,Sit on bench facing away from middle pulley. Place neck in harness cable attachment. Place arms on lower thighs for support. Move head away from pulley by bending neck forward until chin touches upper chest. Return head by hyperextending neck and repeat.,Positioning pulleyÂ higher will alter tension curve by decreasing effort required near initiation of concentric contraction while increasing effort required near end of concentric contraction. Positioning pulley slightly higher than what is shown will allow greater effort in middle of movement.,['Sternocleidomastoid'],https://exrx.net/application/files/5514/5309/4670/CBNeckFlexion.gif
Cable Neck Flexion (with belt),https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Sternocleidomastoid/CBNeckFlxBelt,"Attach belt on low pulley cable by attaching carabiner on belt buckle. Grasp attached belt, face away from pulley, and place head in belt loop. With belt above ears, clamp belt snugly around head by tightly gripping ends close to back of mid-head. With neck braced and assistance of arm, lunge forward to angle torso forward with feet staggered. Place hand on lower thigh for support. Pull head forward and down by flexing neck until chin touches upper chest. Return by hyperextending neck until head is angled upward. Repeat.","Use neck to pull belt rather than allowing hand to assist. Keep clinched grip on belt against back of mid-head throughout movement.
